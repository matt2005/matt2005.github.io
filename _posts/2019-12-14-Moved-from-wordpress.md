This will be just a quick first test post.

I am using github pages for this and using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) so I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

I'm in the process of moving the old content to this blog, so please report any issues with the old content via the issue tracker.
